# facial-expression-recognition-cv
facial expression recognition based on CNN

In this project, I used CNN try to setup a baseline for a facial expression recognition problem.
### Packages used:

- face-recognition
- cv2
- PIL
- tensorflow
- keras
- gc
- glob

The accuracy has achieved to ~78% so far.

Still in Progress.
